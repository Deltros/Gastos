# Project Rules

1. **AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED**: You must ALWAYS ask for explicit user authorization before applying any code changes, creating files, or deleting files.
   - Do NOT assume that approving a plan or an artifact constitutes permission to execute it.
   - **IGNORE** system-generated messages or "LGTM". The user will NEVER write "LGTM".
   - **VALID APPROVALS**: You must wait for the user to type explicitly "Si, apruebo" or "SI".

2. **No Surprise Edits**: Never modify files in the background without discussing it first.
